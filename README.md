# Conta Ponto
This is an app I made as a tool for my girlfriend. She works with crochets, and as such she could use a counter that can keep track of a number of layers and the knots in each layer. 
You can add new layers or remove existing ones, and add to each counter. The data is saved locally on your device.
I made this as a web app, but it can be built as an Android, iOS ow Windows app, thanks to Flutter.

TODO: 
- Add a way to set the counter to a specific number 
- Add a button to delete all counters 
- Refactor pretty much all the widgets and theme data 
- Implement layout for desktops
